### Echo is a two-team project developed during the [Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-bootcamp).

It is a ReactJS web app designed to allow its users to search for and save Youtube videos to their profile and save specific time snippets to that, which they can later play in a loop.

#### Tech stack

Our app is powered by the Youtube search API​. We built our client side using the Create React App toolchain and used React Router for the front-end routes. Our server runs on Node.js' Express framework​ and we used PostgreSQL to create and interface with our database​.

Once the functional part of the website was built, we applied a touch of React Bootstrap components and a spoonful of SASS.
